"""Self-check: the lifter emits one definition per start address.

Two discovery passes can seed the same function start with different ends.
Emitting both is a C redefinition error (the file never compiles), and keeping
the shorter one silently drops real instructions -- libsre's 0x30001848 lost
its `stdu r1,-0xB0(r1)` frame setup and six register saves that way, which
would corrupt the stack of anything that called it.

Run: python tools/test_lifter_dedupe.py

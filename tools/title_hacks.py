"""Title-specific contamination in shared code.

The runtime and the HLE libraries are supposed to be game-agnostic -- that claim
is the whole pitch of the toolkit, and it is what somebody forking it to port
their own title is relying on. In practice a long bring-up leaves behind env-gated
scaffolding named after whichever game it was written for, in the shared files
every other title also runs through, and nothing notices.

This counts it, so draining it is measurable, and ratchets it, so it cannot grow
back while we drain:

    python tools/title_hacks.py             # report, grouped by file
    python tools/title_hacks.py --by-var    # report, grouped by variable
    python tools/title_hacks.py --check     # fail if the count went UP
    python tools/title_hacks.py --update    # re-record after draining some

A hit is a getenv() in shared code whose variable starts with a known title
prefix. Adding a new title's prefix to TITLE_PREFIXES is a deliberate act, which
is the point: it should be awkward to bake a fourth game's name into sys_event.c.

ponytail: a denylist of known titles, not an allowlist of approved prefixes. It
catches everything in the tree today. Switch to an allowlist when an outside fork
starts contributing, because that is when "MYGAME_HACK" stops being hypothetical.

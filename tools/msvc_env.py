"""Find the MSVC toolchain environment, without hardcoding a Visual Studio version.

clang-cl needs the MSVC headers and import libraries, which only exist in the
environment vcvars64.bat sets up. In CI a GitHub action does that before anything
runs; locally nothing does, so every tool that shells out to a compiler has to
arrange it. Doing that by writing a literal path into each tool is how
test_ppu_lift.py ended up pointing at "Visual Studio\\18\\Community" -- a version
that is not installed on the machine this is being written on, which silently
reduced a 1300-case conformance suite to compiling nothing.

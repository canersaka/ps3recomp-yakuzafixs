/* spu_lifted_fallback.c — lv2 glue: run a LIFTED SPU job as a PPU-fallback.
 *
 * The lv2 SPU-thread-group layer (lv2_register.c) runs each SPU thread by looking
 * up a PPU-fallback for its image entry point and calling it on a host thread with
 * (tid, args_ea, args_size, user). Register this wrapper with `user` = the lifted
 * entry fn (from spu_lifter), and lv2 will execute the lifted SPU code on the
 * thread's local store with the SPURS task arg in r3:
 *
 *     spu_register_ppu_fallback(image_entry, spu_lifted_fallback, (void*)lifted_fn);
 *
 * This bridges the lv2 SPU-thread layer to the lifted-execution layer — the brick
 * the flOw SPU integration needs (feed lifted jobs as task bodies).

ps3recomp - macOS host
======================

Drag ps3recomp.app onto the Applications folder to install.

What this is
------------
A native Apple Silicon build of the ps3recomp host and its Metal RSX backend.
Launching it opens a window driven by a real NV4097 command buffer: the guest
clear colour, and a triangle whose vertices are fetched out of emulated PS3
guest memory as big-endian data. Close the window to quit.

What this is NOT
----------------
This does not run PS3 games. No PS3 title renders gameplay under ps3recomp on
any platform yet. This is the graphics bring-up harness that backend work is
developed against -- it needs no game binary, which is precisely the point.

Command line
------------
The binary inside the bundle takes flags:

  ps3recomp.app/Contents/MacOS/ps3recomp_bin [--draw] [--frames=N]

  --draw       issue a real DRAW_ARRAYS as well as the clear
  --frames=N   run N frames (0 = until the window is closed)

  PS3RECOMP_METAL_HEADLESS=1 renders offscreen and asserts the presented
  pixel, exiting non-zero on mismatch. That is what CI runs.

The app is ad-hoc signed, not notarised. If macOS blocks it, right-click the
app and choose Open, or run:
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ps3recomp.app

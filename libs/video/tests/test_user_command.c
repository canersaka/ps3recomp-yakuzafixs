/*
 * ps3recomp -- GCM_SET_USER_COMMAND header decode
 *
 * The FIFO walker in cellGcmSys.c splits a method header into
 * (type, count, subchannel, method). GCM_SET_USER_COMMAND is method 0xEB00,
 * which is WIDER than the 13-bit field that decode keeps -- so it lands as
 * subchannel 7 / method 0x0B00, not as anything resembling 0xEB00. That is why
 * it was being routed into the 2D engine path and discarded, and the routing in
 * the walker is written in terms of the split values.
 *
 * ps1_netemu is what makes this matter: its user-command handler posts the
 * semaphore its flip path blocks on, so a dropped 0xEB00 parks the emulator.
 * If someone widens the method mask, this fails instead of the emulator
 * silently going back to zero frames.
 *
 * Build:
 *   clang -std=c11 -O2 test_user_command.c -o t.exe && ./t.exe

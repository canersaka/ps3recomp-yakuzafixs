/* edat.h -- transparent NPDRM (EDAT/SDAT) decryption for the filesystem layer.
 *
 * PSN content ships its payload as an EDAT: an NPD header followed by AES-encrypted
 * blocks. On hardware the guest does NOT decrypt these itself -- it calls
 * sceNpDrmIsAvailable(klicensee, path), which primes the kernel, and every later
 * cellFsOpen/read of that path returns PLAINTEXT. A runtime that opens the file
 * literally hands the guest ciphertext, and the guest reads a garbage header.
 *
 * ps1_netemu hits exactly this: it opens USRDIR/ISO.BIN.EDAT, finds nonsense, and
 * exits with `ExitPS1(): code=3` / `CoreBoot() failed`.
 *
 * So the FS layer resolves it instead: on open, a file beginning "NPD\0" is decrypted
 * once into a cache file and the cache is opened in its place. Every read/seek/stat
 * path above then works unchanged, which is why this is a path substitution rather
 * than a read hook.
 *
 * Scope: uncompressed EDATs with AES-CMAC block hashes -- the common case, and what
 * PSOne Classics use. Compressed blocks and the SHA1-HMAC hash modes are detected and
 * refused by name rather than silently mis-decrypted.
 *
 * Keys are the published NPDRM constants (the same ones RPCS3, scetool and every EDAT
 * tool carry); a license-type-3 "free" EDAT needs no per-console RAP. A type-1/2 EDAT
 * is bound to a RAP we do not have, and is refused with that stated.
